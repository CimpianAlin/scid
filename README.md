Scid is a multi-platform (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows) chess
database application.

With Scid you can maintain a database of chess games, search
games by many criteria, view graphical trends, and produce
printable reports on players and openings. You can also
analyze games with the Xboard or UCI compatible chess
program, play online on FICS, and even use Scid to study
endings with endgame tablebases.

Scid is free software and is released under the GPL licence.
